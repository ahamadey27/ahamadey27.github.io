                <h2>Samurai Movie Database</h2>
                <p>
                    As a samurai movie aficionado, I have a hard time keeping track of all the different films out there. Many contain very similar themes and names (Vendetta of a Samurai VS Samurai Vendetta, for example). So to keep a tight grasp on my DVD collection, I curated database of classic samurai films built with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. 
                    This full-stack web application provides an elegant platform to manage and display a 
                    comprehensive collection of samurai movies, featuring user authentication for administrators and a 
                    public-facing, searchable catalog for visitors. The project demonstrates core .NET development skills 
                    including database design, server-side filtering, and secure user management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication, 
                    with a clean server-rendered frontend using Razor Pages. The application supports full CRUD operations 
                    for movie entries, server-side filtering by title, director, and year, and uses SQLite for persistent data 
                    storage. Ready for deployment to Azure App Service or other cloud platforms.

                <h2>Text to AI Speech Model</h2>
                <p>
                    My friend, Jeff, once made a good point about how the droids communicate in Star Wars - 
                    how they communicate with each other in the same rhythm and tempo as humans when they could be 
                    communicating wirelessly or, at least, speak a hyper fast language that only they can comprehend. 
                    So, I set out to create that language! This innovative web application transforms text into a unique audio 
                    "language" using rule-based sound synthesis and the Web Audio API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and powered by the Web Audio API, this application converts textual 
                    characters into distinct audio frequencies, durations, and waveforms using a sophisticated character-to-sound 
                    encoding system. Features include multi-waveform support for different character categories, real-time audio 
                    playback, comprehensive character set mapping, and server-side validation. Deployed on Azure App Service with 
                    modern web development practices.

                <h2>Wake Advisor</h2>
                <p>I was stand-up paddleboarding on the Hudson River, and as a massive freighter passed by, its 
                    wake generated an amazing wave that peeled off the river's edge. Very satisfied after catching 
                    this wave, I came up with the idea to create a web app that integrates real-time tide predictions 
                    and live AIS vessel tracking. The app pinpoints windows when low tide (≤ 2 feet) coincides with 
                    the approach of a southbound freighter, maximizing wake surfing opportunities.</p>
                <p>
                    This prototype is built with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and a modular C# backend that integrates real-time data from external APIs. 
                    The app fetches tide predictions from NOAA and attempts to track southbound freighters using AIS data, 
                    with all API endpoints and geolocation settings managed via configuration files. 
                    Please note: current AIS coverage for Hudson River freighters is limited, so live vessel tracking is 
                    not always available until a more comprehensive data source is integrated.

                <h2>Death in the Gulag (Unity Game)</h2>
                <p>
                    My first project as a junior developer was creating a full game from scratch using C# scripts in 
                    the Unity Game Engine. It taught me the basics of object-oriented programming, methods, and how to create 
                    flow by creating and modifying scripts. In addition to the scripts, I made all the music, sound design, 
                    sprites, and animations to create a haunting feel of what it was like to be trapped in the Soviet Gulag. 
                    This atmospheric horror survival game challenges players to hear the true stories of what these people had to 
                    endure and witness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built entirely in Unity 2D with custom C# scripting, featuring hand-crafted pixel art animations,
                     original atmospheric soundtrack, and immersive sound design. Successfully published on Steam, 
                     demonstrating complete game development lifecycle from concept to commercial release, including play testing, 
                     bug fixing, and platform-specific optimization for Windows distribution.
